    <h1>3000 most common words in English</h1>
    <p class="description">
      With 2,500 to 3,000 words, you can understand 90% of everyday English
      conversations, English newspaper and magazine articles, and English used
      in the workplace. The remaining 10% you'll be able to learn from context,
      or ask questions about. However, it's essential to learn the right English
      vocabulary words, so you don't waste your time trying to memorize a huge
      collection with very little benefit. The list below seems long, but when
      you can use all these words with confidence, your English vocabulary will
      be fully functional.
